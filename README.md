# Jarvis
[![Heroku Docker Deployment](https://github.com/dotchetter/Jarvis/actions/workflows/heroku_ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dotchetter/Jarvis/actions/workflows/heroku_ci.yml)

Jarvis is my personal assistant application, developed with my framework [Pyttman](https://github.com/dotchetter/pyttman). 
Jarvis is used by me and my family. He tends to our private shared finances, helps us with recipies, warns us about weather 
precautions and more.
